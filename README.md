# PrePPT

## Overview
PrePPT is an AI-powered assistant that helps users create PowerPoint presentations using OpenAI's technology. It automates the slide generation process by producing individual content slides with a title and main content. Each slide is numbered appropriately, making it easy to organize and use.

## Features

- **Topic-Based Content Creation:** Users provide a topic or a brief description, and the application generates relevant slides.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive design to assist users effectively.

## How It Works
1. Enter a topic or a brief description of the presentation.
2. The application uses OpenAI to generate relevant slides.
3. Each slide contains a title and key content.
